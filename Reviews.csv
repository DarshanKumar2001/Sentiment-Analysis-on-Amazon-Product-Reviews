I wasted my money. Lots of hangings and very slow. Network issues. This is not a 5G or even equal to 1G. Please do not buy this and waste your money. I asked for a refund but Amazon saying is can be replaceable. Not a good service by Amazon and don't know why they are selling such a third class mobile.

My usecase - I replaced by secondary phone Redmi Note 4 - wanted to 5G phone with good battery and Sub 15K price tag. Primary use as a GPS navigation in car, Gaming and backup Hotspot phonePros -1) Very lightweight and extremely well built2) ColorOS is flawless - simple, elegant and bug free3) Decently fast phone and responds to quick touches well - especially while using at 90hz4) Able to handle games easily - its a future proof chipset5) Aesthetically, no concerns - decent phone to carry around6) Great connectivity with my various bluetooth enabled devices - My Bose 700 soundbar, Oppo Enco X TWS and even my fitbit smart band.7) Surprisingly good video call quality on selfie camera8) rear Camera setup - since not my primary phone, but if i have to rate it, i will give it 7/10.Cons -1) 18w is a decent charging adapter - but if u r used to faster charging, this will dissapoint you2) screen brightness is good, but being an ips LCD display, it will still keep you wanting more3)Mono Speakers are decent but not loud enough.

Phone was awasome in its price range.there only 2 problems for this phone1 call recording it says when we start call recording. And auto call recording was only for contacts in mobile.2 mobile heat issue while charging.

Phone design and look is ok... Camera quality is average (as I bought it for only 14000) it could be a way better.The phone has unique manufacturing defect that it gives error message while using that |the phone temperature is very high"" and automatically phone data and other programme stop working...Even the phone body not heat that much... This is the major issue as you can't use mobile data or camera without restarting the phone or leave for 10minute hold...

Pathetic camera quality, network connectivity and video call picture & voice. Voice is coming broken. I request everyone who is willing to buy this phone, please please don't buy this phone, specially when u r willing to buy from Amazon. They r cheating with customers. On 2nd day i tried to return this mobile but they r not returning it, they want to send technician. What technician can do with the camera quality.

Never ever buy this phone. This is a failed model. Camera quality and performance is below 1 star. Battery life is half an hour if you are streaming videos and plus it takes more than an hour to charge which is opposite to company's commitment. This is completely waste of money.The below review is for Amazon company.Plus whe I tried to return they asked me arrange for visit at home to check the phone. The technician did not show up however they updated on system that the visit was completed which is wrong.

Very nice phone, I brought it at an offer period, but it cost is little bit more,Battery backup decentCamera clarify very goodPerformance... Very nice...Snapdragon Proceccer is the best compare to mediatek. Budget friendly phone, 128 gb and extra slot for increasing memory, 6 gb ram... Very good... Face recognition system and finger print sensor are awesome.....

Phone is heavy. Annoying app in phone which you cannot remove. No one will write about the bloatware. This is data stealing strategy adopted by big players in market. I wonder after paying 18k for phone still I have to deal with bloatware. It's better to take phone with stock android like Micromax.

The Product is nice the Only issue is with Charging time. It claims 18W fast charging but taking more than usual to charge. It took around 120 minutes to charge from 41-100%. Either the charger supply is underrated or company is claiming it wrong.

Being an IT Head I always look for tech specifications of a mobile before purchasing the same.  After a lot of browsing, reading about specifications about the latest mobiles 6GB+128GB, I've selected this product to gift this product to my Daughter on her birthday. A little bit confusion was there about the product. But when my daughter received it, she is very happy about the specification & about the look. The glossy finishing of the back is too pretty. My daughter has installed the 'Genshin Impact' in this mobile, it is running very smooth way. And I've checked all of the functions of the same. Camera resolutions is too good. One of the best product.

I am writing this review after three and half month of purchase. I have purchased a few mobiles beforr but never got so much frustrated like this one. As per my opinion, not worth the money, typing is the worst experience for me as well as the sound quality. I do neither play games nor watch movies, so no review for that.If you are a phone addicted person, then you shouldn't go for this one. Touch quality os also very poor in comparison with money. Overall comparing with price my rating is maximum 2.7/5.

Best smart phone I have purchased so far in such reasonable price with exchange of my old phone I got Rs 4000 discount. There are lots of advance and useful features in this phone which will give you the feeling like the costly phones. Great feeling in hand like a chocolate bar and you want to bite it. Excellent design.

The product was ordered on 7th Nov, 21. It was delivered late i.e. received on 13th Nov 21. The product was not working from 17th Nov 21. Dint turn on.Unable to return as the return last date was 16th. When went to service center they said the board is fault.How an newly purchased product hardly used for 3 days has board issue.They don't provide replacement since the invoice date was 7th the date when I ordered.The warrant started before even I received the phone. This is really ugly

This mobile phone is the best phone available under ‚Çπ 20,000 with 5G technology.  Here are some of the features of this phone:Pros -1. Cheapest phone with a 5G snapdragon processor, dedicated memory card slot with two SIMs.2. It's dual 5G phone which means you don't need to change the SIM slot to change the 5G usage between two service providers.3. 6 GB RAM which can be enhanced by 5 GB extra.4. Good battery life. It is running almost 40-45 hours with descent usage which includes WhatsApp, news reading and other daily usage with 4-5 hours of wi-fi support to laptop.5. Supports almost all the features required in a mobile of this category with many shortcuts.Cons -1. Doesn't have IR blaster which is required to use it as a remote control.2. Camera is decent but could have been better.3. Size is little large for men but almost all the phones are coming with this size only and hence, we don't have options.4. Too many pre-installed apps which can't be removed/uninstalled/disabled.There are other phones in the competition but all others lack some or other feature e.g. dedicated memory card slot or snapdragon processor (as mediatek processors are leading in 5G race).

It's a choice able budget 5G smart phone. Very good looks, built quality decent, performance smooth, display and touch excellent, battery acceptable, voice and sound quality very good, no network issue, no heating issues, but cameras not good at all. SAR value is low in this segment 5G(Head: 1.066 & Body:0.607).Though it's the review after 18 hrs of uses. The actual review will be done after 1month of uses.

Just loved it ....Cons: 90hz refresh rate is just awesome .Finger print sensors are too good and even face lock.The processor is smooth and the battery is just love easily last for 1.5 days with normal use and a day with heavy use.Cons : I haven't found any cons.

Device is little heavy. Camera quality is average and not appear of 48 mega pixel. Camera quality has really disappointed me. Screen is also not soothing for eyes. Overall, it's doesn't satisfy the brand reputation and money spent on it.

I was happy to get the phone at a price 17k. However, the feeling is vanising slowly as the phone screen is glitchy(during audio calls the display vanishes and appear like a CRT TV without cable connection-signal noise on screen). This is my second phone from OPPO and both times made me hate the company more.

Worst display. I used to have honor phone before which is of premium quality. The one thing I don't like here is the picture quality or the display quality. It's worst. The  icons color etc is very bad looks like North Indian orange. The pixels spread across in the image. Please go to store and check the phone before you buy. In Amazon you cannot access display qualityProsBattery life seem to be good. However Need to wait and seeNo heating issue so farNo performance issues. Note that I am not playing games just regular user5g is of no use.

Pros:-1. Display (Best display you can get at this price i.e.  Super Amoled with 90Hz Refresh Rate2. üîã Battery (6000 mAh big battery)3. Camera ( 64 mp) and selfie (20 mp) and if you  know you know samsung image processing  software.4. Looks and back Design ( Awesome Pattern with  rainbow üåà reflection.)5. Compact Size (6.4inches) not too big and not  too small.......handy..Cons:-1. Processor (mediatek helio g80) which is a low  end processor and it might not affect your  overall performance if you are not a heavy  gamer or something like that.2. Infinity U display. Nowadays drop notch display  is kinda outdated look since overall look of the  phone is great but this small thing is like a black  spot on a white chart paper.##But Also keep that in Mind how can you get  everything in just 14999 -17999 ........in mid  range...these specs are perfect and at last you  can trust the brand name too.üòè

Cons:1.Good phone at this price.2.Display Quality is really great. Looks premium3.Camera is also very nice in daylight. In indoor it takes some shacky images.4. For Normal use I think it is best phone considering Samsung √Ämoled display and security.CONS:1. Could have been better if it comes with strong processor2. Samsung should have provided a Back case3. This phones support 25w charger but only 15w charger is provided so there must be 25w charger in the box

I am sure there will be many reviewers who will do an in-depth analysis and list out the pros and cons of the device. So here i am pointing out the negatives that i felt . First thing first, the ring volume is mediocre. Ring is not at all loud and i wondee whether I have recieved a faulty device.Second thing i loathe is that, the back cover is a fingerprint magnet. Some kind of resin or composite material is used.To be honest, i didn't like the phone much. The design is outdated and sub par a 10k phone. Since bought this for an elderly person, the ring volume was a total bummer for me. Thats it, another useless review from me.

I purchased this phone on 16999 from Amazon by exchange .but I did not find any quality as per this high price.1. Phone touchscreen is very slow and sometimes hangs stop working.2 while viewing YouTube the voice is not coming clear sometimes voice going up and down ,  microphone and speaker of this phone is not up to the mark even I should say worst. Of its kind.3 this phone is marketed as 6 gb ram but most of the phone memory is already approx 3 gb is occupied by pre-installed app which you can not remove. This is complete cheating with customer regarding storage.4.in whatsapp I am unable to select the more  photos. Its processor is very slow.even slower than  my previous phone .Do not waste the money on the premium phone like these.Better go for any other company

Believe me, it's the slowest mobile I saw. Don't go on screen and Battery, it is an extremely slow mobile phone and takes ages to open and navigate.

I'm a just a basic user of phones.  No movies, no games.  I mainly use phone, messages, photos, chats and other social apps and some utilities.  For the price, the features seem impressive and for my mild usage this phone sounds great.What I did not like is the amount of apps that were already installed on the phone!  Then I had to un-select a whole bunch of ""recommended"" apps during setup.  I was pre-subscribed to 'diagnostics' and 'recommendation' and 'marketing' notification by default!  Is that allowed?  Some features don't work unless I use specific apps.  Basically, they are app features and not phone features.  Sounds 'grey-area' to me.After spending half a day to go through all the settings and clean up the mess I think I'm ready to use this phone.  I still wonder what else I missed...

Processer is good.Both side Camera performance is good.Camera functions is work properly.In Screen look use face sacaner than fingerprint.Provide pre-installed apps Samsung system,  Microsoft system, Google system and Netflix's ,Amazon, etc.Charging capacity is too low, take 1¬Ω hr to charge.Fingerprint sacaner too small, many times its doesn't match.Lots of app pre-installed.25GB memory used out of 128.

I am fully disappointed with this model.perfomance wise not good . Operating app is also slow taking so much time to open and download app .aslo taking so much time to charge after 40 % any mobile take 45 to 60 min to full charge but this mobile take around 90 to 120 min to charge.not worth it .not recommended to any one .

Battery Life is very poor .Even though it is 6000 mah battery it doesn't last a full day and needs to be charged atleast twice a dayEven though it is less than one month it's UI constantly stops and have to be closed.The response is extremely poor .I have been using One Plus 5 for the past 2 and half years and its response is better than this new device which is hanging and apps are crashing time and again .I had preferred an Indian phone to Chinese one but have been extremely disappointed with the performance of this phone

My review after a week of usagepros-------*Battery - lasting for 2 days*Display - Great AMOLED display*Separate slot for memory card*Camera is also goodcons-------*Sometime touch is not working.*Battery - taking 3 hours to get fully charged. Nowadays we can get phone charged within 2 hours*Notification light is missing. Every time we need to on the button to check whether we have received any calls or messages*It is said that 15w charger but in adapter it says 10w (5.0 V = 2.0 A)*Too much of unwanted apps are pre-installed*Very outdated processor.

Amazing phone. I would rank it the best overall phone experience. The pros are obviously known to everyone, the 90hz display is great. The touch feel is literally like butter. Cameras are great. Amazon prime runs in HD so widewine l1 is there. Speakers are loud, not tinny but lack bass. Can't complain.Phone requires careful first time setup to avoid ads as suggested by ranjit sir. No ads encountered yet. Everything works well, side mounted power button /finger print reader is fast and accurate. Light sensor, proximity sensor are flawless. These 2 are typically bad in Chinese phones (mi note 5 pro user) causing display to turn on when in call, so thumbs up.The cons: the processor seemed weak on paper, but the experience is great. Not that I am defending samsung, but a compromise 90% can blindly make. I do not play games, so can't say much but better processor phones out there. This is for general public who wants smooth experience of samsung phone and no software bugs.Some complained of emmc5 storage, but apps installed damn fast and I did not find and sluggish read write speed issue. Fast and phone did not heat during setup process when installing 100s of apps and no slowness observed. I have 2 m30s in house, they also pointed out better build quality, better looks of my black version and fluidity of screen. Good for light gaming. Go ahead with the phone for good vibes throughout phones life. Now samsung is giving 3 years of software updates, so great.

This is my first review of Any product purchsed online. I'm shopping online since ages now. But this Phone FORCED me to write a review.I've been Using Asus Zenfone phones till date for my usage, Had a wonderful experience....First time ever shifted to Samsung just because of so called Brand Name.WORST DECISION.Camera OK.Battery OK.Performance OK.Screen OK.Brightness OK.Within 1 week Lock switch stopped working.I'm locking and unlocking by screen tap option because samsung people have said it'll take time to repair.Body completely cheap plastic material.Heats up with normal usage.When in pocket automatically wakes up and starts typing numbers or dials emergency number.With No disregard to Samsung I'm saying very bad phone you've made.Very overpriced. Should be of 9k or less.Others opinions may differ from me. This is just my personal experience.I'm sorry to give you less stars Samsung but please improve your quality not quantity. There is no mandate to launch new phone every week.

¬†The perfect phone under ‚Çπ15,000 with amazing features...I purchased this phone last month and received it on October 6th. It's been 1 month since i have used this phone and it works perfectly fineüòä1. Amazing camera quality (64mp backcam and 20mp front cam)2. Superb battery life.. (6000 mah)3. Massive storage (128GB internal and 6 GB RAM)4. Finger print sensor at the right side of tge phone makes it even more special.. (power off/on button and the finger print sensor is the same)5. You can double tap on the screen to on/off the phone6. Face recognition7. Always on display options are available8. Video lockscreen option is available9. Good processor10. Good display11. Doesn't lag or slow downAnd many more exciting features...It's the best phone under this price range..I bought it for ‚Çπ14,000 during the great indian festival.I wonder why some people posted negative reviews about this perfectly amazing phone..If you have plans to buy this phone..

Pros: Screen resolution is good. Speed and performance is ok ok. Sometimes got little sluggy during parallel execution. Camera is very good quality. Battery life is good. SW is really smooth. Speaker is louder enough. Finally it's not a Chinese brand.Cons: No 4k or HDR video viewing. So some videos are blurry even though it is HD. During charging phone gets heated up. Tats may be it has bigger battery. 5G support is not Der since most phones are now with 5G. Price might have been little less to compete Chinese brands.

purchased this phone on 16999 from Amazon by exchange .but I did not find any quality as per this high price.1. Phone touchscreen is very slow and sometimes hangs stop working.2 while viewing YouTube the voice is not coming clear sometimes voice going up and down , microphone and speaker of this phone is not up to the mark even I should say worst. Of its kind.3 this phone is marketed as 6 gb ram but most of the phone memory is already approx 3 gb is occupied by pre-installed app which you can not remove. This is complete cheating with customer regarding storage.4.in whatsapp I am unable to select the more photos. Its processor is very slow.even slower than my previous phone .Do not waste the money on the premium phone like these.Better go for any other company

Display is good and bright. Battery  average. It's not that speed being 6gb ram, while making  call it lags. Camera not upto mark, I miss grand camera which was better  than 64 mp. Over priced, don't have basic features  of other M series phone. On the name of brand Samsung started cheating people.  They should  atleast  provide  cover.

After purchasing Samsung M12, was looking forward to getting M31, but the mobile was not available and the prices increased. After waiting for a month, saw that M32 is available so purchased it but not entirely happy with it. The phone rings on its own at times, chimes continuously other times without any call or notification being given. Phone lags at time and opening apps also takes time. Perhaps the 6gb variant is better but I have 4gb model. OneUI was supposed to be stable and I am quite disappointed with this particular purchase at least.

best Non-Chinese smartphone preference under 15K | Excellent battery | Decent Camera | Smooth | Stylish look | Mummy Loved it ( I gifted it to her)Not made for chhapri youth icons of India.Not the best camera phone under 15K.for gaming under 15k > Motorola G40 / POCO is better option.if you are a decent user, who loves to watch videos/ browse social apps then definitely go for this.for Mumma/PAPA this would be best choice rather than Chinese smartphones.(Thumbs UP) BATTERY : Screen On Time > More than 13H for Mumma. she watches Jio Tv & browse social apps quite often.(Processor) MTK G80 doesn't lag much as compare to Exynos processors + it is better optimized for battery consumption. example Samsung M21 2021 with same 6k mAh battery with Exynos processor gives 7-9h Screen on time only, while Samsung m32 with same 6K mAh battery with MTK Processor gives more than 10-12H screen on time.

¬†A fake and damaged product delivered to me. It's not working properly.  Replacement product delivered to me. It's a question mark on Samsung reputation.  I never used any Samsung products and I advised to my friends and relatives never buy any Samsung products.

Using since last three days ...completely satisfied with everything. In this segment so many phones are available but if i get the SAMSUNG then why i should go anywhere else...Pros:Display - SAMOLED with Full HD, Side Curves make you feel so happy. Brightness is awesome.Sound - Dolby Sound is also good specially with wired headphone.Battery - Without internet 2 days do not worry to charge it and with internet one full day.Call Quality : Also goodVideo Calling - BestCamera : Picture is so goodProcessor - Fast as it comes with 90Hz refresh rate.Cons:Notification LED Indicator is missing but can be managed.RAM could be 8 GB but if you choose the quality then it can be also ignored. 6GB also working fine.Verdict: If you are not a GAMER then blindly you can grab it.

From my usage over a month and taking it to a trip where network reception was absent 90% of the time, my reviews are this:-Display is great, surely compares to flagship devices, the sAMOLED Infinity-U display is really something else, bright, brilliant, vibrant and with the 90Hz refresh rate (laggy animations appear sometimes), quite responsive too. It is miles ahead from smartphones in this range.-Camera is pretty nice actually and surprised me a bit, especially from budget Samsung line, however, it does have a habit of oversaturation in some minuscule scenarios, low-light photography is average, just average as can be expected from phones of this range.-Battery is AVERAGE at best, please keep this in mind before buying, don't let the 6000mah figure fool you, for powering a display of that much calibre the battery lasts a day to a day and half depending on usage but NOT more than that in any case. The 15w charger provided requires a good 2-2.5 hours to charge up the 6000mah battery. 90hz display is a battery drainer, so I set mine on 60hz for the trip, for office/home scenario where frequent charging is not an issue 90hz is great albeit laggy animations appear sometimes.-Back panel is polymer based and is prone to fingerprints, smudges and scratches, so a light case is the right way to go.-Network reception is great for both WiFi and cellular and does not suffer from the low signal issues faced by some M31 users, etc. Bluetooth works well too.-Fingerprint sensor is snappy but coming from a phone where it was present on the back, it takes time getting used to and is sometimes just a tad bit slow, nothing to worry about.-External speaker volume is bad to average, it is not at all loud, I am not criticising this, maybe a lot a of people prefer quiet phone speakers but it is sometimes hard to hear ringtone or notification sounds especially from a phone where notification LED is absent.-Always on Display is present but reduces the battery percentage 1-2% at most.Summing up the above, overall, great viewing experience, camera is alright, battery is average, speakers are disappointing.-STRICTLY NOT a performance beast by any means, great for everyday or business usage. NOT for gaming.-Have not observed heating issue as of yet.Hope this helps, Cheers!

¬†I've been using this phone from last 25 days and facing screen heating and ghost touch issue.  I visited the Samsung service center and they installed new software but issue isn't solved. Now I've to admit phone for physically checkup. If new phone giving bad experience like this how can we trust Samsung brand. üôÉ  is it really trustworthy brand these days ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Seeing few YouTube videos,I purchase it,  It's 7-Days now.Processor is G80 , Which Don't support 90Hz& Don't support 2k Videos & Pics.,But, People who use for minimum usage like 2-3hr YouTube,  Amazon videos good.Most time it's 60hz , so, u feels Videos üìπlag ,When u take FHD pic it takes 2-4sec to save it.I am feeling M40 which I got 3-years back is much faster..So, Always go with Snapdragon processor..

Cons: 1) Slow processing2) Getting error messages like Sim refresh3) Some time call does not get connect..However after restart call gets connected...but this happened quite sometimes..Hence it's main function of mobile is not 100%Pro: 1) Camera2) Battery life so far good.As this phone is slow from now not sure how it will perform after 6 to 12 months. And hence giving 1 ratings.Learning/ Suggestions one should  buy a good processor phone...

Writing this review after almost a month of using the product.First off, I want to emphasize that the value for the product is just great.Build Quality:The body & screen are toughened and have a premium feel. The ""rainbow"" reflective back seems a bit weird to me, I would rather prefer a plain, smooth finish but that's just my personal opinion.Camera:Okay, this is probably the biggest topic to discuss on. Camera quality does not depend on the megapixels, it depends on the processing engine of the device. Megapixels are only useful for zooming in. So whether you have a 64MP phone, or a 108MP phone, the pixels don't matter. The processing engine matters (which is why the iPhone 11 with just 12MP shoots way better photos).The camera is mediocre, neither too good nor too bad. It does have a night-mode which is pretty decent. If you are into professional photography, you're better off with the Oneplus Hasselblad or the iPhone.But if you just take photos casually to post on social media, it does its job pretty well.Size & ease-of-usage:One can be a bit skeptical when using a device that is sized more than 6 inches. However, Samsung absolutely nailed the ease of use with the inbuilt scroll gesture on the power button. The power button is sort of like a laptop's touchpad, when you swipe down on the button, it will open the notification tray from where you can get access to your WiFi controls, etc. To close the menu you just have to swipe up on the power button. This is a really unique & useful idea because when you can use only one hand, it is uncomfortable to scroll through the top of the screen, but this gesture makes it super easy!Processor & Performance:Being a previous Snapdragon user, I was skeptical about moving onto the Mediatek family of processors. But given the size of RAM & storage, this device is perfect for semi-competitive gaming. Of course, you cannot expect it to perform like the Asus ROG Phone series, but you can get around 45-60fps at high graphic settings on AAA titles, which is pretty good. The 90Hz screen is fantastic too, and the gameplay experience is smooth & fluid.Screen:Not much to say here, it performs as expected. The 90Hz sAMOLED display is crisp & smooth. You also have an option to switch to 60Hz refresh rate to save battery.Battery:Just super! You can easily go for 3 days without a charge if you're not a frequent user. Medium gaming for 1 hour consumes around 6-8% battery. But if you just use it for messaging/calling/checking mails and casual gaming, the 6000mAH will easily last you for 2-3 days.Final verdict:I think that Samsung has done a really good job with the price range here. The phone offers plenty of features, which, as compared to the price are justified. If you're looking for a device around the 15k price range, go for it!

Do not buy. There are plenty of other good options for the price. Main issue is the PROCESSOR.  I just felt it's too slow compared to  the mobiles available.  Phone is also bit thick . And I think its manufacturing is stoped too.  It's only sold online. If I had a chance I would buy a different phone .

Don't waste money on redmi or realme jst in sake for money. This phone is very nice for decent users. It is an all-rounder in all tasks, but for decemt usage. Camera is very nice than redmi, realme, oppo etc. Notch is very small and does not disturb. One UI 3.1 has tons of features to customize. My rating 8.5/10.All the Best!
